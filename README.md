# Debian Details Page for Microsoft Azure (Front-end Only)
The purpose of this project is demonstrate my HTML and styling + UX skills for Debian's DEBIAN CLOUD IMAGE FINDER in **Google Summer of Code-19**.

### Project Overview
> Developed a front-end for Debian Details Page for Microsoft Azure which is a applicant's task for [original project](https://wiki.debian.org/SummerOfCode2019/ApprovedProjects/DebianCloudImageFinder).

### Applicant's Task
The idea that they have for a "Details page" is to provide access to the latest and older Debian images of that specific cloud provider, helping user in scenarios like these:

* "I want to run debian 9 on Microsoft Azure, where do I need to go to run this vm via the web interface (https://portal.azure.com/#create/credativ.Debian9, https://portal.microsoftazure.de/#create/credativ.Debian9 for Azure Germany)"
* "How do I run it via the cli client (az vm create --image credativ:9:latest $options)"
* "I want to run debian 8 on google compute engine, what is the exact url of this specific image version"


### Why This Project?
* This version of webpage is responsive so it can be used on various devices.
* Proper use of Bootstrap4.
* Copy to Clipboard via JQuery.
